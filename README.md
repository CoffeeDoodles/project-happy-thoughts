# Happy Thoughts

Practice using React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API, in this case in the form of a happy-thought message posting app.

## The problem

The big problem is I didn't really finish the previous project and I was feeling incredibly behind, underprepared, and very over-whelmed. I didn't think I was going to understand anything and fall further behind. I had to rewatch the code sessions mutiple times as well as practice on outside sources like codecademy and read through alot of the React documentation.

However I did get every working and I am proud of myself for that! I even managed to make more components than we did in the code sessions on my own. While I don't understand everything 100% I didn't end this project feeling the same sense of dread as when I started. In fact I think i even found React a bit fun to do now. 

If I had more time, I'd add proper accessibility and try to accomplish some of the red or black level goals. I think I could figure them out if I tried now.
